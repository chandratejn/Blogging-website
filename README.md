# Blogging-website

Development of a simple blogging website which allow users to create, edit, and delete blog posts.

Features:
1) The website has a static header with a "Create a Post" button. By default, the page does not show any blog posts.


2) A modal will appear when a user clicks on the "Create a Post" button. The modal contains a form allowing users to input their blog post's title and description. The title input is of text type, while the description is a textbox. 

3) The modal inludes an "X" button to allow the user to close it.

4) After the user saves/publishes their blog post, it appears on the main page along with the Edit and Delete Post Buttons.

5) Users can edit or delete their blog posts. If a user clicks the delete button, the selected blog post should be removed from the page. If a user clicks the edit button, a modal will appear with the title and description already filled out, allowing the user to edit the post.
